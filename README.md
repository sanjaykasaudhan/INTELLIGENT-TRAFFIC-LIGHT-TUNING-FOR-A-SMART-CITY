Tournament selection and adaptive mutation strategies for optimal convergence

Simulation Engine:
Microscopic traffic modeling with realistic vehicle arrival patterns
Dynamic queue management across 4-phase signal systems
1-hour simulation with 1-second resolution for high-fidelity results

Adaptive Control:
Rolling horizon re-optimization every 15 minutes
Responds to time-varying traffic demands throughout the day
Maintains optimal performance under changing conditions

📊 Key Results
✅ Reduced average wait times compared to traditional fixed-time signals
